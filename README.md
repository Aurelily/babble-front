Overview
---
✏️ **Babble Chat App made for my CDA (Application conception and development) certification (RNCP Title lvl 6)**

Babble is a chat mobile application which allows users to connect and converse with others. Babble allows user creating and joining themed chat rooms, where people can engage in lively real time discussions with fellow “Babblers”.
The name "Babble" stems from the notion of chattering and conversing in English.

With Babble, you can create chat rooms and find communities of “babblers” sharing your interests. Whether you're passionate about sports, movies, technology, or anything in between, Babble offers you a space to discuss about. You can also create your own private chat rooms and invite friends for more intimate conversations.

Built with React Native, Babble is a multi-platform application that runs seamlessly on both iPhone and Android devices. This ensures that users can enjoy the Babble experience regardless of their preferred mobile operating system.

Babble’s back-end infrastructure is using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) which allows me to create a flexible and scalable foundation for my application. The MERN stack is renowned for its effectiveness in building social networking applications.
